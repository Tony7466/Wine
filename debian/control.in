Description: Register Wine as the interpreter for Windows executables
 Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
 .
 This package registers Wine as an interpreter for Windows executables, using
 the kernel binfmt_misc module.  This causes Wine to be invoked automatically
 whenever a Windows PE (Portable Executable) file is to be launched.
 .
 WARNING:  This increases the risk of inadvertently launching Windows
 malware, so please make sure that you understand the security risks before
 blindly installing this package.
 .
 This feature is probably most interesting for automatic software testing.
 Desktop users usually don't need it, so don't install wine-binfmt unless you
 know that you need it.  Refer to Wine's README.debian for more information.
