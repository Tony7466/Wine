wine for Debian
---------------

Wine is now split up into the following packages:

wine            (metapackage, depends on everything you probably need)
wine32-bin      (core 32-bit binaries and configuration)
wine64-bin      (core 64-bit binaries and configuration)
libwine         (core libraries)
libwine-dev     (Winelib development headers and tools)
libwine-dbg     (debugging symbols)

Also note that Wine for Debian is set up to use a wrapper script,
where /usr/bin/wine is a shell script that starts the real Wine
binary, which is in /usr/lib/wine. These days, the script doesn't
do much more than warn you if Wine is invoked from your mail reader
or web browser, to help you avoid trojans, viruses, and worms. Except
it might also warns you if you're suffering from some known common
system misconfiguration that may prevent Wine from working properly.

Other resources
===============

If (i.e. when) you have problems, the Wine Troubleshooting Guide
can be found at http://www.winehq.com/Trouble/

The Wine FAQ can be found at http://www.winehq.com/FAQ/

If you need debs of previous Wine versions, perhaps because of some
regression, you should be able to download archived debs from
http://snapshot.debian.net. This site archives the entire Debian
package repository daily, and you can download any previous version
of any Debian package from there.

If you're running Debian stable, and your Wine version seems too old,
you can usually download reasonably recent Wine packages from
http://www.backports.org. This is a repository for packages built from
package sources from Debian testing, backported to Debian stable, which
should cover most user's needs.

Feel free to visit the Debian Wine packaging's homepage for more
resources, go to http://pkg-wine.alioth.debian.org/

Configuration
=============
The best way to configure Wine is to run winecfg.

(Note that if you see a resolution setting in there and you think
jacking it up to max is a good idea, think again. It probably doesn't
do what you think it does, and the Wine forums are plagued with users
trying to recover from their mistake.)

If you need to set up Wine manually, without winecfg, you
can force the creation of a ~/.wine directory by running
"wineboot".

If you're upgrading from a previous Wine version, Wine will attempt
to upgrade the configuration in ~/.wine automatically.

Or, if you're desperate, you can always completely wipe your Wine setup
with "rm -rf ~/.wine". This will destroy everything you've installed,
including their configuration and data files, so if you have anything
important in there, back it up first. You can then start afresh.
