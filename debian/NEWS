wine-development (1.9.16-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Debian has two sets of Wine packages: wine and wine-development. They now use
  the Debian alternatives system to provide /usr/bin/wine and other commands.

  If both are installed this system defaults to use the commands provided by
  wine (no change in behavior because wine already provided these unsuffixed
  commandnames previously).

  But if configured, or if only wine-development is installed, you may now use
  wine-development's commands without the "-development" suffix.

  For more information on this please have a look at README.debian.

wine-development (1.9.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Wine now uses a shared 64-bit wineprefix per default if wine32 and wine64 (or
  wine32-development and wine64-development) are installed. For more
  information on this please have a look at README.debian.

  * The package wine (or wine-development) needs to be installed in any case
    now.
  * Existing 32-bit wineprefixes don't get changed and continue to work.
  * Existing 64-bit wineprefixes in $HOME/.wine64 aren't found
    automatically anymore if you are running Wine from a terminal, while
    Desktop launchers continue to work. You may rename the prefix to
    $HOME/.wine and adjust any launcher, or run:
    $ export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine64"
  * The wineserver is now in PATH, its old filepath doesn't exist
    anymore. Any existing WINESERVER configuration must be dropped or
    adjusted.
