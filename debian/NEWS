wine (1.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Wine now uses a shared 64-bit wineprefix per default if wine32 and
  wine64 are installed. For more information on this please have a look
  at README.debian.

  * The package wine needs to be installed in any case now.
  * Existing 32-bit wineprefixes don't get changed and continue to work.
  * Existing 64-bit wineprefixes in $HOME/.wine64 aren't found
    automatically anymore if you are running wine from a terminal, while
    Desktop launchers continue to work. You may rename the prefix to
    $HOME/.wine and adjust any launcher, or run:
    $ export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine64"
  * The wineserver is now in PATH, its old filepath doesn't exist
    anymore. Any existing WINESERVER configuration must be dropped or
    adjusted.
